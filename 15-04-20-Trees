Terminolotree
root (no parent), leaves (no children)
parent/child
  - nodes can have at most 1 parent
  - nodes can have many children
full vs. balance
  - full - not capacity, filled up? (full is always balanced)
  - balance - is tree lopsided?
  
Taxonatree
(max # of children)
- binary tree
- ternary tree
- quad tree

- binary search tree (sorted version)
- splay tree
- red black tree
- heap 

implementation
node - data, left, right (bianry)
tree - node (only gets data)
  - add(value)
  - remove(value)
  
Balanced tree - all subtrees heights differ by no more than 1, and all subtrees are balanced

TreeNode<T>
BTree<T>
  add(T data) // wrapper for recursive method
  add(TreeNode<T? branch, T data) // O(logn) choose child randomly
  
Transversal - pre order, post order, in order // O(n)
