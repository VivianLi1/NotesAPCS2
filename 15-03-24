Stacks and Queues Array Implementation

Add and remove are both constant time in stacks and queues
linked list routine runtime (stays the same no matter what) 
If done with an array, add/remove in stacks would have the same time, but queues would take longer
stack have variable to keep track of size

Stacks Add
n * O(1) + O(N) /n ---> kO(n)/n 
*amertized (averaged) cost is O(1)

Queues Add
O(1)* 
remove
O(1)

counter for head and tail
eq(1)
eq(2)
eq(3)
dq()

0 1 2 3 4
H
T

0 1 2 3 4
H T

only resize when reaching end

Double Ended Queue (DEQ) - next assignment (10)
add and remove from either side in constant time - can use it as stack or queue

priority queue
higher priority = goes first
priority bumps up slowly - jobs do not wait forever
